# Statistical Modelling
Is a tool for understanding complex relationships in data and making informed decisions based on evidence. It combines theoretical foundations practical techniques to provide insights into real-world problems acros various disciplines, from economics and biology to social sciences and engineering. Mastering statistical modelling involves not only understanding the methods and techniques but also critically assessing assumptions and interpreting results in context.

## models

- **Statistical Models**: A mathematical representation of a relationship between variables.
- **Linear Regression**: A method used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: A method used to predict a binary outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**: A framework that extends linear regression to handle various types of outcomes, such as count data or binary data.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: A method used to compare the means of multiple groups to determine if there are significant differences between them.
- **Regression Diagnostics**: Techniques used to assess the assumptions of linear regression models and identify potential issues.
- **Multilevel Modeling**: A method used to account for hierarchical or nested data structures in statistical modeling.
- **Bayesian Statistics**: A methodology that uses Bayes' theorem to update probabilities based on new evidence.
- **Resampling Methods**: Techniques used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic, such as the bootstrap or cross-validation.
- **Model Selection**: Techniques used to choose the best-fitting model among a set of candidate models.
- **Model Validation**: Techniques used to assess the performance of a statistical model on new data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: A method used to analyze and forecast data collected over time.
- **Spatial Statistics**: A method used to analyze and model spatial data, such as geographical patterns.
## Key Concepts in statistical modeling

1. Variables
 - Dependent variables- the outcome or response variable that we want to understand or predict
 - Independent variables- the input or predictor variables that we use to explain or predict the dependent variable

2. Types of Models
 - Linear Models: Linear regression, logistic regression, and generalized linear models. they assume a linear relationship between variables
 - Non-Linear Models: Non-linear regression, generalized additive models, and neural networks. they can capture complex relationships between variables
 - Time Series Models: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, exponential smoothing, and state-space models. they are used to analyze and forecast time-series data
 - Generalized Linear Models: Extend linear models to accomodate non-normal distributions or non-linear relationships.

3. Model Fitting
 - Parameter Estimation: Unsing statistical techniques (like maximum likelihood estimation or least squares) to estimate model parameters that best fit the data
 - Model Evaluation: Assessing how well the model fits the data using goodness-of-fit measures (e.g., R-squared for regression models)

4. Model Selection
 - Choosing the most appropriate model based on criteria like simplicity, predictive accuracy and interpretability.
 - Techniques include cross-validation, information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC) and hypothesis testing.

5. Assumptions and Diagnostics
 - Checking assumptions underlying the model (e.g., normality of residuals in linear regression)
 -Diagnosing model adequacy and identifying influential data points
## Steps in Statistical Modeling 
 1. Define the problem: Clearly articulate what you want to study or predict
 2. Data Collection: Gather relevant data that represent the phenomenon of interest.
 3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the data through summary statistics, visualizations and initial hypothesis
 4. Model Specification: Decide on the form of the model (linear, non-linear, etc.) and select the variables to include
 5. Model Fitting: Fit the chosen model to the data using statistical techniques
 6. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques
 7. Model Diagnostics: Check the assumptions made by the model and identify any issues
 8. Model Interpretation: Interpret the results of the model in the context of the problem
 9. Model Application: Use the model to make predictions or make decisions based on the data
## LINEAR REGRESSION
is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables where one variable is the predictor (independent variable) and the other is the outcome (dependent variable).It assumes that there's a linear relationship between the predictor X and Y
The formula for simple linear regression is:
Y = b0 + b1 * X + ε
where:
- Y is the dependent variable
- X is the independent variable
- b0 is the intercept (the value of Y when X = 0)
- b1 is the slope (the change in Y for a one-unit increase in X)
- ε is the error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values of Y)

```python
#let's do this in python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Generate some random data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) #gen random numbers between 0 and 2
Y = 2 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Create a Linear Regression object
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X, Y)

# Get the coefficients (slope and intercept)
intercept = model.intercept_[0]
slope = model.coef_[0][0]

# Generate predictions
predictions = intercept + slope * X

# Plot the data and predictions
plt.scatter(X, Y)
plt.plot(X, predictions, color='red')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.show()
